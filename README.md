# Project 2 for CITS2002

- This project is *really* dumb but we **have to** do it
- $f(x) = smart(x) \therefore f(CITS2002) DNE$

  
TODO:
- Initialize the page table for each process.
- Load pages into RAM.
- Access pages and determine if they're in RAM or need to be swapped from disk.
- Simulate swapping pages in and out of memory (i.e., page faults).
- Create files called in.txt which contains the process ids (0,1,2,,3)
